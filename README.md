ðŸš¦Road Accident Analysis Power BI dashboard

ðŸš¦ Thrilled to share this interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing road accident data across the UK



This comprehensive visualization offers actionable insights into traffic casualties and accident trends across multiple dimensions, including vehicle type, road type, location, and environmental conditions. Key highlights:



âœ… Total casualties broken down by severity (fatal, serious, slight) with YoY comparison

âœ… Casualties by vehicle type (car, bike, van, bus, etc.) for targeted transport insights

âœ… Geographic heatmap pinpointing accident locations for spatial analysis

âœ… Monthly trend analysis to identify seasonal patterns

âœ… Filters by road surface and weather conditions for deeper exploration

âœ… Light condition breakdown (day/night) to assess risk factors



This dashboard supports transportation authorities, urban planners, and policymakers in enhancing road safety and making data-driven decisions to reduce traffic-related injuries and fatalities.
